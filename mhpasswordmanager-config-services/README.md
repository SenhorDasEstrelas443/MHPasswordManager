# MHPasswordManager-Config-Services
this is an open-source project by me ([@marcoshssilva](https://github.com/marcoshssilva))

## Profiles

If you want to use this project in `local` or `docker`, you can use profile `native` to run
this project without extra settings.

Only you can need is run services included in docker:

- redis
- postgres
- mongo
- rabbitmq

Profile *local* assumes that you will run all apps via Localhost

Profile *docker* assumes that you will run all apps via host.internal.docker
